# Contributing Guide

## Goal
Keep contributions small, focused, and easy to review. The point is to practice Git workflows, not to build a large product.

## Style
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Keep changes scoped to a single goal.
- Prefer short paragraphs and readable formatting.

## Branching
- Create a feature branch per change.
- Use simple names like feature/add-note or fix/typo.

## Pull Requests
- Use a short title.
- Explain the intent in 1-3 sentences.
- Link to the exercise you completed (if any).

## Merging
- Merge via the pull request.
- Squash merge is fine for practice.
